    <p>Peter Theil, an entrepreneur behind PayPal, Palantir, and Founder’s Fund recently wrote an op-ed for the New York Times entitled <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/01/opinion/peter-thiel-google.html">“Good for Google, Bad for America”</a> that dealt with AI. His position can be summarized by “AI is inherently a military technology, but Google seems to be sharing its work with a malevolent foreign power. We should be worried about that, and not let Google escape criticism.” This is in response to Google’s Fei-Fei Li’s opening of a basic AI research lab in China.</p>

<p>First, let’s look at “AI is inherently a military technology.” I’m currently using this ‘militaristic’ technology to classify video game trading cards, but let’s ignore that part. I think I’m going to rely on a lesson taught to me by the Superfriends in the episode <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0776309/">Monolith of Evil</a>.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/posts/2019-8-10-Reaction-to-Theil/superfriends.jpg" /></p>

<p>For backstory, the Legion of Doom finds something they call the “Monolith of Evil”, an all-powerful tool that can do pretty much anything. They wreak havoc with it, creating an ice monster that attempts to destroy a bridge, among other things. The Superfriends win by using the Monolith against the Legion of Doom, prompting Grodd (of the Legion) to say “I don’t understand. How could the Superfriends control the forces of evil?” Batman responds with “It wasn’t an evil power source, Grodd. But, like anything else, becomes good or bad depending on how it’s put to use.”</p>

<p>AI, I think, is the same way. Sure, there are militaristic applications such as Project Maven, but overall AI’s uses in healthcare, autonomous driving, finance, and other sectors show that the applications that harm humans are the exception, not the rule.</p>

<p>As an aside, though, it seems to me that advances in computing historically stem from the military: magnetic-core memory<sup>[<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whirlwind_I">1</a>]</sup>, electronic general-purpose computing<sup>[<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ENIAC">2</a>]</sup>, and bombes<sup>[<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bombe">3</a>]</sup> all were US military projects.</p>

<p>Incidentally, while they remain relevant, these initiatives remain largely secret, such as the Enigma decoders not being acknowledged publicly until 1970<sup>[<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enigma_machine#Surviving_machines">4</a>]</sup> despite being designed in 1939.</p>

<p>Next, let’s look at China. Theil raises several points, so let’s delve into them.</p>

<p>First, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Firewall">Great Firewall</a>. Google’s justification for going abroad with their research efforts was that ‘AI and its benefits have no borders.’</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/posts/2019-8-10-Reaction-to-Theil/firewall.PNG" /></p>

<p>I think this point is valid. In a bit of a parallel to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradox_of_tolerance">Paradox of Tolerance</a>, being open with technology that could be used for suppression would lead to suppression in this case, not openness. I agree with Theil that Google is being a bit naive in this case.</p>

<p>Next, civil-military fusion. “This” refers to Ash Carter’s pointing out that “If you’re working in China, you don’t know whether you’re working on a project for the military or not.<sup>[<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/07/18/ex-defense-secretary-ash-carter-google-has-a-duty-to-the-us-not-china.html">5</a>]</sup>”</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/posts/2019-8-10-Reaction-to-Theil/civil-military-fusion.png" /></p>

<p>Looking around on Twitter, though, it seems the author has something to say about the use of his linked article:</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">It&#39;s really nice that Thiel linked my article on military-civil fusion in this NYT op-ed. <br /><br />Too bad he didn&#39;t read it. Bc, if he did, he wouldn&#39;t make an erroneous claim like MCF &quot;mandates that all research done in China be shared with the [PLA]&quot; <a href="https://t.co/hM7PxEMKGK">https://t.co/hM7PxEMKGK</a></p>&mdash; Lorand Laskai (@lorandlaskai) <a href="https://twitter.com/lorandlaskai/status/1157314963821735936?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 2, 2019</a></blockquote>
<script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>This op-ed also bigger than just a discussion about the applications of AI. Theil’s op-ed seems to have reached the Trumps as well, with both Trump and Trump Jr. tweeting about it:</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Peter Thiel Slams Google for Sharing AI Technology with China | Breitbart <a href="https://t.co/D9LLL5cXXs">https://t.co/D9LLL5cXXs</a> via <a href="https://twitter.com/BreitbartNews?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@BreitbartNews</a></p>&mdash; Donald Trump Jr. (@DonaldJTrumpJr) <a href="https://twitter.com/DonaldJTrumpJr/status/1157420939392540672?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 2, 2019</a></blockquote>
<script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">“Billionaire Tech Investor Peter Thiel believes Google should be investigated for treason.
