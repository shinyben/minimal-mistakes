My first blog post! I've been 'blogging' for personal record-keeping for a while now, but this will be my first public-facing blog.

The push to start comes from this tweet:

My goal is to work for OpenAI/DeepMind/Google Brain after I finish school, and I'm going to use this blog to hone my skills.

Let's see where this takes me!
