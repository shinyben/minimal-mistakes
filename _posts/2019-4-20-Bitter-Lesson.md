title: "Summary of Sutton's The Bitter Lesson"

Rich Sutton, a professor of Reinforcement Learning (RL) at the University of Alberta and the guy who wrote the book on RL, recently wrote a blogpost entitled ["The Bitter Lesson"](http://www.incompleteideas.net/IncIdeas/BitterLesson.html). To summarize, "General methods augmented by massive computation are the most effective. Attempts to 'put' human knowledge into systems make the systems plateau and ultimately fail."

First, the post summarizes progress made in the games Go and chess, and then speech recognition, deep learning, and computer vision. Sutton points out that, in all cases, statistical methods that utilize massive computation have won out over the efforts that attempt to make the computer 'think the way humans think' and plug in human heuristics.

It's a rather short blogpost, and I would recommend reading it yourself, but I've pulled out several quotes that I think summarize its feel rather nicely:

<blockquote>The biggest lesson that can be read from 70 years of AI research is that general methods that leverage computation are ultimately the most effective, and by a large margin.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Search and learning are the two most important classes of techniques for utilizing massive amounts of computation in AI research.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Again, the statistical methods won out over the human-knowledge-based methods. This led to a major change in all of natural language processing, gradually over decades, where statistics and computation came to dominate the field.</blockquote>

<blockquote>As in the games (chess and Go), researchers always tried to make systems that worked the way the researchers thought their own minds worked---they tried to put that knowledge in their systems---but it proved ultimately counterproductive, and a colossal waste of researcher's time, when, through Moore's law, massive computation became available and a means was found to put it to good use.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The second general point to be learned from the bitter lesson is that the actual contents of minds are tremendously, irredeemably complex; we should stop trying to find simple ways to think about the contents of minds, such as simple ways to think about space, objects, multiple agents, or symmetries.</blockquote>
