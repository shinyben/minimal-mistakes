# Inspiration

Coming from a musical family, Eli wants to be able to play ukulele with his young daughter. He does not have full mobility in his left side, so he needs to be able to play with only his right hand. We designed an automatic strummer attachment with Eli that allows him to strum the ukulele by tapping his foot on the ground and finger chords with his right hand.

# What It Does
To strum, Eli taps his foot on the ground in our foot "pedal." Each tap is wirelessly communicated to the strummer attached to the ukulele. By tapping his right foot to the rhythm and fingering chords with his right hand, he has full control over the tempo and frequency with which he strums.

# How We Built It
Our strummer is controlled wirelessly using radio communication, giving him flexibility in playing while sitting or standing. Eli taps his foot on the floor in our foot "pedal", which detects his tap through a break in the laser beam sensor. Each time his foot breaks the beam, the strummer moves down and up once to strum the ukulele. The strummer is made with a small servo and custom-made pick arm made of sheet metal and compliant plastic.

We built a mounting fixture of acrylic to hold the strummer and electronics, which follows the natural curve of the ukulele. We used adjustable clamps to attach this to the ukulele so that the mount and strummer can be easily detached from the ukulele in one motion. The foot pedal is made of acrylic and the beam breakers are fixtured on either side.

This serves as the explanation and documentation for the one-handed ukulele project.

9. [IR Break Beam Sensor](https://www.adafruit.com/product/2167)


First, we want to test the break beam.

<img src="/assets/img/projects/athack2020/break_beam.jpg" width="" height="" border="" />

We find and modify an Arduino program to do so (credit to [Adafruit's basic tutorial](https://learn.adafruit.com/ir-breakbeam-sensors/arduino)).

The crux of the program is `loop()`, which runs continuously after `setup()` is run.

Essentially it loads whether the beam is broken into the variable `sensorState`, and then turns the LED on if the beam is broken. Otherwise it turns the beam off.

```
void loop(){
  // read the state of the pushbutton value:
  sensorState = digitalRead(SENSORPIN);

  // check if the sensor beam is broken
  // if it is, the sensorState is LOW:
  if (sensorState == LOW) {     
    // turn LED on:
    digitalWrite(LEDPIN, HIGH);  
  }
  else {
    // turn LED off:
    digitalWrite(LEDPIN, LOW);
  }

  if (sensorState && !lastState) {
    Serial.println("Unbroken");
  }
  if (!sensorState && lastState) {
    Serial.println("Broken");
  }
  lastState = sensorState;
}
```

The next thing to do, after we verify the break beam is functional, is to verify that the radio transceivers work as expected. Unfortunately the break beam verification wasn't as simple as was hoped: we had some issues surrounding our breadboards, which took around 30 minutes to pin down. The internal connections were shaky, so we changed to a more standard set of breadboards.

We took the circuit in the above image, which we used to test our break beam, and modified it by simply adding on our transceiver module. Now when the beam was broken, the Arduino was coded to talk to the transmitter, which then sent out a signal to the receiver.

This is a picture of the transceiver:

We used the tutorial [here](https://create.arduino.cc/projecthub/muhammad-aqib/nrf24l01-interfacing-with-arduino-wireless-communication-0c13d4) to get the basic logic and call syntax, which we then modified for our purposes. It didn't work out of the box, so we cut out the expressive communication and simply read a binary "strum/no strum" signal, which suited our purposes.

Here is the `loop()` of the transmitter, `loop()` of the receiver, and the wiring diagram for the simple transceiver circuit:

Transmitter:
```
void loop() {
    button_state = digitalRead(button_pin);
    if (button_state == HIGH) {
        const char text[] = "Your Button State is HIGH";
        radio.write( & text, sizeof(text)); //Sending the message to receiver
    } else {
        const char text[] = "Your Button State is LOW";
        radio.write( & text, sizeof(text)); //Sending the message to receiver
    }
    radio.write( & button_state, sizeof(button_state)); //Sending the message to receiver
    delay(1000);
}
```

Receiver:
```
void loop() {
    if (radio.available()) //Looking for the data.
    {
        char text[32] = ""; //Saving the incoming data
        radio.read( & text, sizeof(text)); //Reading the data
        radio.read( & button_state, sizeof(button_state)); //Reading the data
        if (button_state == HIGH) {
            digitalWrite(6, HIGH);
            Serial.println(text);
        } else {
            digitalWrite(6, LOW);
            Serial.println(text);
        }
    }
    delay(5);
}
```

Essentially we changed the button in the above diagram to a signal from the break beam. From there, we were essentially done! The foot control (a break beam) and the ukulele could now talk to each other. All that was left was to translate the signal into coherent strumming instructions, and hook those instructions up to the mechanical side.

Here's the final product!
