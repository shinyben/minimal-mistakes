A small project using Golang.

This can be described pretty quickly, and it only took me a day: I used the Spotify API to match the tracks in the playlists from [track blaster](track-blaster.com) to Spotify track elements, and then populated a new Spotify playlist with those tracks if they existed.

I'm hoping to augment my college's radio station, WMBR, with a program that makes playlists from the tracks they play. Another fun application that I could make by just reversing the process is taking a Spotify playlist and turning it into a track-blaster playlist so DJs don't have to do the rather mindless task of data entry.
