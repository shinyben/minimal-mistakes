The project started with a dinner to meet the co-designers - the people ATHack (Assisitive Technology Hack) was designed around. After going around to the tables, introducing myself, and listening to the different requests, the problem I was most excited about solving was Anette's.

Anette had an interesting request: because she was deaf, she couldn't hear the doorbell when guests came to her house, and would like to change that. Our solution was a vibrating bracelet connected to Anette's home doorbell system.

It was interesting to get experience with PCB fabrication, laser cutting, 3D printing, and textiles, though. The grad students with whom I was working showed me around the technical side of things, and I came away from the project having learned a lot.
